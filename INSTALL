Prerequisites
-------------

In order to compile oaconvert and its unit tests, you need to have the following
software installed:

  cmake
  a C++ compiler (g++ or clang)
  CppUnit

To be able to create Garmin maps, you also need this tool to convert files in
Polish format to Garmin IMG format:

  cgpsmapper (available from http://www.cgpsmapper.com/)


Step 1: run cmake
-----------------
To generate the Makefiles, run cmake in the root directory.  If necessary,
remove the CMakeCache.txt file first:

  rm -f CMakeCache.txt
  cmake .

Step 2: compile the source
--------------------------
To compile the source and obtain the oaconvert binary, change into the src
directory and run make:

  cd src
  make

=> You should now have a libairspace.so and a oaconvert file in the src
   directory.

Step 3: generate the OpenAir, Polish and GPX maps
-------------------------------------------------
To generate the OpenAir, Polish and GPX maps, change into the utils directory
and run the extract_maps.sh script.

  cd ../utils
  ./extract_maps.sh

=> Under the root directory, you now have a build directory with the different
   maps in OpenAir, KML, Polish and GPX file format.

Step 4: generate the Garmin maps
--------------------------------

To generate the Garmin maps, you need the cgpsmapper command-line tool.  If you
plan to generate the maps on Windows, you also need the cpreview tool.  You can
find both at the cGPSmapper website (http://www.cgpsmapper.com/).  Once these
are properly installed, change into the cgpsmapper directory and run the
create_garmin_maps.sh script:

  cd ../cgpsmapper
  ./create_garmin_maps.sh typ_file_bart_chessboard.txt

The typ_file_bart_chessboard.txt file is a TYP-file where all polygon and line
types for your Garmin are defined.

=> Under the build directory, you now also have a garmin directory with the
   Garmin maps.

Step 5 (only Windows): install the Garmin maps
----------------------------------------------
Make sure you have a working installation of NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install
System), available from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/.  Start up Windows and
open and run the create_setup.nsi NSIS installer script with the 'HM NIS Edit'
program, available from http://hmne.sourceforge.net/

=> You now have have a <somefilename>.exe setup file that you can run
   to install the maps.  The installer will copy the maps to a directory of
   the user's choice and will also make the necessary changes in the Windows
   registry so that everything works nicely with MapSource and BaseCamp.
