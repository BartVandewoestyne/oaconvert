Step 1: run cmake
-----------------
To generate the Makefiles, run cmake in the root directory.  If necessary,
remove the CMakeCache.txt file first:

  rm CMakeCache.txt
  cmake .

Step 2: compile the source
--------------------------
To compile the source and obtain the oaconvert binary, change into the src
directory and run make:

  cd src
  make

=> You should now have a libairspace.so and a oaconvert file in the src
   directory.

Step 3: generate the OpenAir, Polish and GPX maps
-------------------------------------------------
To generate the OpenAir, Polish and GPX maps, change into the utils directory
and run the extract_maps.sh script.

  cd ../utils
  ./extract_maps.sh

=> Under the root directory, you now have a build directory with the different
   maps in OpenAir, Polish and GPX file format.

Step 4: generate the Garmin maps
--------------------------------
To generate the Garmin maps, change into the cgpsmapper directory and run
the makemaps.sh script:

  cd ../cgpsmapper
  ./makemaps.sh

=> Under the build directory, you now also have a garmin directory with the
   Garmin maps.

Step 5 (only Windows): install the Garmin maps
----------------------------------------------
Startup Windows and open and run the create_setup.nsi NSIS installer script.

=> You now have have a <somefilename>.exe setup file that you can run
   to install the maps.
