Loading a Garmin map that exists as a combination of a TDB, REG and IMG file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
File
  -> Load Map
    -> Set map type 'Garmin' and choose 'MyFileName.TDB'
      -> QLandkarte offers you to choose <some_number>.img or 'MyFileName.img'.
         It is not clear to me what you should pick... both seem to work...

If you don't see the map, it can help to select 'Map -> Center Map'.
