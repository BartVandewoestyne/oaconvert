For air sports, knowledge of airspace is very important.  There are a lot of
areas where it is forbidden to fly or where there are certain limitations.  The
detailed information of airspaces is described in a country's Aeronautical
Information Pages (or AIP in short).

A group of enthusiastic pilots, with initiator Bart Vandewoestyne from Belgium,
has built a tool called 'oaconvert' to translate the airspace descriptions in
the AIP files to files that allow visualization of these airspaces in Google
Earth and on your Garmin GPS.

The coordinates and characteristics of a certain airspace are first described
in a so-called OpenAir file, which is a textual standard language for
specifying airspace.

Once the OpenAir files are declared, oaconvert (which stands for 'Openair
Convert') allows you to translate the OpenAir file into various other formats,
for example Google Earth's KML file type which is shown here.

Unfortunately, it is quite unpractical to use Google Earth when flying.
Oaconvert therefore also allows you to translate the OpenAir files into a file
format that you can upload to your Garmin GPS, as can be seen in this picture.

On your GPS it looks like this.

Depending on your flight position, you get information about the airspace on
your screen.

Besides a visual indication about the places where you are not allowed to fly,
you also get information about the maximum permitted altitude.

Areas which may be activated by NOTAM or AUP, will be shown in a separate line
type.

At this moment, airspaces of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and parts of
Germany and France are available.

OAconvert is an Open Source project, available to an international public via
the GitHub social coding website.  Everyone can contribute to the code and add
more airspace files.  You are cordially invited to participate!
