We can try to use a regular expression C++ software library to parse the
OpenAir commands.

The C++0x standard update had added regex support to the C++ standard library.
-> It is based on the Boost RegEx library:

   http://onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/04/06/boostregex.html
   Look for functions like match_results and regex_replace.

Other search terms could be 'regex capturing'.

Qt also has support for regular expressions.
